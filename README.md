# ScheduleDuty Add-on

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

This Flask application provides a UI for the [ScheduleDuty](https://github.com/lfepp/scheduleduty) tool to import schedules into PagerDuty. Once the application is spun up on a server, the application can be added as a [PagerDuty add-on](https://support.pagerduty.com/hc/en-us/articles/223222987-What-is-a-PagerDuty-Add-on-) to import schedules without having to leave the PagerDuty web application.
